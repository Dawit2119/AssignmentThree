                                        If you knew your real worth and if you started perusing what you deserve then most probably you will find that everyone is putting you down simply because people feel uncomfortable when they find someone attempting to do what they never managed to do. The more you believe in yourself the more will people put you down and tell you that you wont reach anything.

                                        It will be impossible to keep trying while everyone is putting you down unless you believe in yourself. The road to success is tough, its full of criticism, sarcasm, hard times and tough moments. 
                                        Most people who don't believe in themselves collapse under this kind of pressure. If you want to succeed in life then you must believe in yourself for if you didn't then no one will.

                                        In order to be successful you need to do what unsuccessful people didn't do and that's 
                                        why you must dare to be different. When i decided to quit my information technology career to focus on my business most people told me that i was crazy, later on i discovered that crazy

                                        It is home to a number of endangered species, including the Ethiopian

                                        Nelson Mandela was one of Africa’s finest citizens and 
                                        statesmen. He was a South African president (1994-1999) 
                                        who fought against the apartheid political system in the country.
                                         As South Africa’s first black president, his government tackled key 
                                         racial systems that segregated and tore apart the country’s diverse races.  
                                         Mandela was a revolutionary who got imprisoned on several occasions for his activism.

                                            from the country’s colonial masters (Britain). One can conclude that 
                                            he was the founder of Ghana, without being too wrong. Nkrumah was the
