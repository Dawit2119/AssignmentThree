                                        If you knew your real worth and if you started perusing what you deserve then most probably you will find that everyone is putting you down simply because people feel uncomfortable when they find someone attempting to do what they never managed to do. The more you believe in yourself the more will people put you down and tell you that you wont reach anything.

                                        It will be impossible to keep trying while everyone is putting you down unless you believe in yourself. The road to success is tough, its full of criticism, sarcasm, hard times and tough moments. 
                                        Most people who don't believe in themselves collapse under this kind of pressure. If you want to succeed in life then you must believe in yourself for if you didn't then no one will.

                                        In order to be successful you need to do what unsuccessful people didn't do and that's 
                                        why you must dare to be different. When i decided to quit my information technology career to focus on my business most people told me that i was crazy, later on i discovered that crazy
